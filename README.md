learn about previously unsolvable problems that can now be solved from solutions devised from data through mathematical 
algorithms and statistical formulas. â€‰Problem-solving is done by reviewing current case studies and examples. The data science workflow will 
be discussed, in detail, independent of any specific toolset.
